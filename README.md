### Run the client
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
Parcel (the bundler) should start a dev server on `localhost:1234`

### To use (because there are no instructions)

You can click in the timelime to move around.  You can double click a word to move the timeline to there (this is buggy but slatejs is being a butt about dispatching to the state reducer).  To "remove" some text, select the words you wish to banish and press `ctrl-r`.  Press play and viola, no more audio.  That's...about it.
